# Todo List v1

The first thing that we need to learn is html, css and javascript. These are the building blocks of all webpages. So this time I want you to build an html page that has a textbox and a button. When you click the button the description in the text box should be shown on the page as a todo item on the same page that the button and text box are on. I am providing you with some starter files. 

index.html
index.js
index.css

1. link the index.css to the index.html file.
